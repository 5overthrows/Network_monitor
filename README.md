# Adaptive Network Monitoring Tool

A real-time network monitoring and analysis tool built as the **core component** of the project  
**“Adaptive Network Defence System: Real-Time Retrainable Firewall & Micro-Segmentation.”**

This repository currently implements the **network monitoring layer** using Python.  
Machine Learning–based detection and adaptive firewall logic will be added in later phases.

---

## Project Objectives

- Monitor live network traffic in real time
- Extract meaningful traffic features
- Detect suspicious activity using rule-based logic
- Log traffic in a structured, analysis-ready format
- Provide a modular architecture for future ML integration

---

## Design Philosophy

- **Prototype-first approach** for rapid development and demonstration
- **Modular architecture** so detection logic can be replaced with ML models
- **Security-focused** (built and tested on Kali Linux)
- **Team-friendly** (GitHub collaboration + virtual environments)

> In future versions, the **Rule-Based Detection Engine** will be augmented or replaced by  
> **ML-based anomaly detection models** trained on live traffic.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Scapy** – packet capture & inspection
- **Pandas** – data handling
- **Matplotlib** – visualization
- **Rich** – colored terminal output
- **Git & GitHub** – version control & collaboration

---

## Setup Instructions (Kali Linux)

### 1️ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/adaptive-network-monitor.git
cd adaptive-network-monitor
````

### Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Tool

Packet capture requires root privileges.

```bash
sudo venv/bin/python main.py
```

You should see:

* Live packet processing
* Rule-based alerts in the terminal
* Traffic logs written to `logs/traffic.log`

---

## Current Detection Capabilities

* Access to sensitive ports (e.g., SSH)
* Abnormally large packets
* Basic traffic anomalies

> These rules are **placeholders** and will later be replaced with ML-based detection.

---

## Visualization (Optional)

```bash
python3 dashboard/visualize.py
```

Displays basic traffic trends from logged data.

---

## Future Enhancements

* ML-based anomaly detection (unsupervised & supervised)
* Live retraining on network traffic
* Adaptive firewall rule updates
* Micro-segmentation of network zones
* Web-based monitoring dashboard

---

## Team Collaboration

* Each contributor uses their own Python virtual environment
* `venv/` and logs are excluded using `.gitignore`
* Changes are tracked and reviewed via GitHub
